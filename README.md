# Verification of AMBA AHB-Lite Protocol using UVM

This repository contains a comprehensive Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) environment for verifying an implementation of the AMBA AHB-Lite bus protocol. The project leverages SystemVerilog, UVM, and reference documentation to ensure protocol compliance and robust functional coverage.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdelrahmanYassien11/Verification-of-AMBA-AHB-LITE-using-UVM.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Folders**
   - Review the [project report](documents/UVM_AMBA_AHB_LITE_REPORT.pdf) for methodology and results
   - Check `/illustrations` for images used in the report
   - Browse `/rtl` and `/dv` for design and verification sources

3. **Simulate**
   - **There are three main ways to run simulations:**
     - **Using the `run.do` file**
       - Run with:  
         ```bash
         vsim -do run.do
         ```
       - Edit `run.do` to specify which tests to run.
       - Coverage results and transcripts are saved for each `UVM_TESTNAME` executed.
     - **Using the `/run_all_tests_update_header_each_time_script` directory**
       - This method uses a `.do` file in combination with a bash script.
       - The script updates the project's header file to change bus widths before each test.
       - All test configurations (various bus widths) are executed automatically.
     - **Using the `/run_close_questa_manually_each_test_script` directory**
       - This approach employs a bash script that:
         - Accepts test names and bus widths as input.
         - Edits the `.vh` header file accordingly.
         - Executes the corresponding `.do` file for each configuration.
         - **Note:** After each test run, you must manually close Questa before the next test starts.
   - **Important Notes:**
     - Methods 2 & 3 will run each test (`X_test`) for all available bus widths (32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 bits).
     - This produces coverage results and transcripts for every configuration.
     - On machines with limited resources, reduce the number of widths or tests to avoid heavy workloads.
   - **General Simulation Steps:**
     - Use your preferred SystemVerilog/UVM simulator (e.g., ModelSim, QuestaSim).
     - Typical flow:
       ```bash
       cd dv
       vsim -do run.do
       ```
